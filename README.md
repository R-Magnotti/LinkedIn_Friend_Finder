# LinkedIn_Friend_Finder
A Python/Selenium program to significantly simplify the process of making connections as a new user.

Due to the regular updates and modifications to the LinkedIn website, some of the functionality of this program will sometimes not work as expected. I will do my best to keep it up to date.

LinkedIn Friend Finder is designed for new LinkedIn users who are tasked with finding relevant connections related to their profession or field. This program will accept some user input criteria and search for potential connections that meet that criteria as close as possbile. Additionally, LinkedIn Friend Finder will continue to attempt connections until the user input desired number of attempted connections is met.
